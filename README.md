# Zhang's Camera Calibration and RGB-IR registration
This proejct describes in brief the implementation of camera calibration method as described by Zhengyou Zhang in his paper [”A Flexible New Technique for Camera Calibration”](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tr98-71.pdf). This repository has been forked from https://github.com/sakshikakde/zhang-camera-calibration, and I have modified and used the utils developed there. 

## To run the code
- Change the directory for the rgb and ir image data(and where they're to be saved) in AutoCalib_mod.ipynb. You will have to change 6 instances, 4 in block 8 and 2 in block 11. In block 11, change directory of the images with reprojected control points.
